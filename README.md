# Machine Learning Graduate Course

Modules of the Fields Institute PhD-level graduate consistents of introductory topics in the mathematics of machine learning, such as deep learning, automatic differentiation, non-convex optimization, probabilistic modelling, stochastic variations, compression ility, probabilistic inference, generative models, adversarial robustness, reinforcement learning and statistical learning theory from visitors and staff at Fields and Vector Institute.   Case study applications to problems in medicine, finance, and manufacturing processes are explored in foundational depths through optimal mathematical expressions.
